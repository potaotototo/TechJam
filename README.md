# Peanut BERTer

A machine learning solution for assessing the quality and relevancy of location-based reviews.

## Overview

Online platforms host massive volumes of reviews, but many are off-topic, generic, or even spam, making it difficult for businesses and users to extract meaningful insights. **Peanut BERTer** tackles this challenge by evaluating reviews along two key dimensions to surface genuine, valuable feedback.

## Key Features

### üéØ Dual Assessment Framework

**1. Relevance Scoring**
- Measures whether reviews meaningfully discuss the business
- Uses semantic similarity between review text and business description
- Powered by `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`

**2. Spam Detection** 
- Identifies duplicated or inauthentic reviews
- Detects unusually high similarity between reviews posted across different businesses
- Uses the same transformer model for consistency

### üîç Quality Filtering Rules

Our solution applies three essential filtering rules:

1. **No Promotions** - Reviews should not contain promotional links
2. **No Irrelevant Content** - Reviews must be about the location, not unrelated topics  
3. **No Rant Without Visits** - Rants/complaints must come from actual visitors (inferred via content/metadata)

### üåç Advanced Processing Capabilities

- **Multilingual Support** - Automatic language detection and translation to English for consistent processing
- **Efficient Data Pipeline** - Handles raw gzipped JSONL review files and converts to optimized Parquet storage
- **Comprehensive Metrics** - Built-in evaluation framework for model performance assessment

## Development Environment

### Primary Tools
- **Google Colab** - Collaborative development, GPU acceleration, and Drive integration
- **VSCode & Jupyter** - Local prototyping and debugging

### APIs Used
